Theme - AI as Productivity Promoter

As the emergence of stronger Al models (such as ChatGPT),intense human labour has higher chance to be replaced by AI. In an era of such trend, human beings might need to adapt to new paradigms of production with the help of Al. Try to give your proposal for such new paradigms, and build prototypes with resources provided.

The machine learning model for a personal virtual assistant is attached in the files above. The dataset studied is from Kaggle, "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nraobommela/health-monitoring-system". In this model, XGBoost was curated using Amazon Sagemaker and Amazon s3, together with python libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.plyplot, etc. For this study, in order to predict the Response Variable ("Causes Respiratory Imbalance"), vitals of patients were passed in to generate the predicted categorical output ('Normal', 'Mild', 'Severe' or 'Chronic'). 
In my data exploratory segment, I used the in-built XGBoost module and generated confusion matrices to determine truth values to the model; which turned out to be within acceptable margins in terms of practical use.
